Product # 1 - PRN W7348
--------------------------
Product Description:
Model Name: V1724
Model Serial Number: 108
Experiment: XENON1T

Failure Description:
Module runs fine if channel 01 is disabled with channel mask register. If channel 1 is enabled, reading data from buffer fails. Buffer is set to read until BERR is read. However BERR is not emitted even after 8MB of data is read (should be maximum buffer size). Increasing software buffer does not work, board does not give BERR when Ch1 enabled.
Repair Location: CAEN Repair Center c/o CAEN S.p.A. - Via Vetraia, 11 - 55049 Viareggio (LU) - Italy
