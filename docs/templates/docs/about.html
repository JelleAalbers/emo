<h3>About</h3>
<br>
<p>
This site was built as a hobby in order to learn web development. It is not required to run the DAQ (you can use some
    command line stuff running in a detached screen) but it is certainly the nicest way. It would be impossible to code
    such a portal in odd hours on nights and weekends if it weren't for the great about of well-documented, open-source,
    industry-grade software packages simply available for free. Here are a few.
    <ul>
    <li>The <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django Project.</a> Django is an immensely popular open-source web
        framework and it runs the backend of this site. Django interfaces with several popular relational databases and
        provides an insanely easy way to power your pages with python functions and pass the data to the frontend. In
        this case we're using Django with the SQL-lite backend. This database stores all the Django-internal models (forms,
        extended user models, etc.) while the actual data crunching is left to pymongo.
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://www.mongodb.org">MongoDB</a>, specifically pymongo. MongoDB is used everywhere throughout the DAQ
        system for its extremely fast speeds and for its multi-lingual (and almost insultingly simple) API. All communication with the DAQ is
        done through reads and writes to a MongoDB database. The fact that the DAQ data is stored in a MongoDB buffer means
        you can look at live data online. Want to look at pulses in a single channel as they are created? No problem. Want
        to browse waveforms that were created by interactions in the detector one second ago? Piece of cake. Want to analyze
        a subset of your data and plot some diagnostics to make sure the quality is good? Super easy.
    </li>
    <li>Various styling packages were used to do things for us so we could focus on functionality. There are not many things
        worse than fighting with css stylings until you have things just right, but luckily a lot of people have already
        done that fighting and shared the fruits of their labors. The main style of the site is powered by Twitter's
        <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>.
        Backend to frontend communication, as well as other high-level Javascript functionality is made easy with
        <a href="https://jquery.com/">Jquery</a>. Other smaller packages helped a lot including <a href="http://devoops.me/">devoops</a>,
        <a href="http://summernote.org/#/">summernote</a>, <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/">Highcharts</a>,
        <a href="http://dygraphs.com/">Dygraphs</a>, and <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a>.
        The cool, 3D, OpelGL stuff is made crazy easy with <a href="http://threejs.org/">Three.js</a>.

        And of course a few development tools like <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> (we would have
        never kept to PEP8 without it) and <a href="https://www.github.com">GitHub</a> make life just so much easier.
    </li>

Do you have a great idea for something to add to this site? Want to check out how modern web development looks?
    Maybe you want to press a button and watch the final WIMP spectrum live-update (it's not impossible ;).
    Pull the code, write your view, and make a pull request. We'd be happy to help you get started.
