<h3>About</h3>
<br>
<p>
This site was built as a hobby in order to learn web development. It is not required to run the DAQ (you can use some
command line stuff running in a detached screen) but it is certainly the nicest way. It would be impossible to code
such a portal in odd hours on nights, weekends, and airports if it weren't for the great amount of well-documented, open-source,
industry-grade software packages simply available for free. Here are a few.
<ul>
    <li>The <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django Project.</a> Django is a popular open-source web
        framework and it runs the backend of this site. Django interfaces by default with several relational databases and
        provides an easy way to power your pages with python functions and pass the data to the frontend. Support for non-relational
        databases is provided using various extension. In
        this site we're using Django with the SQL-lite backend. This database stores all the Django-internal models (forms,
        extended user models, etc.) while the actual data crunching is left to pymongo.
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://www.mongodb.org">MongoDB</a>, specifically pymongo. MongoDB is used everywhere throughout the DAQ
        system for its extremely fast speeds and for its multi-lingual (and super simple) API. All communication with the DAQ is
        done through reads and writes to MongoDB collections. The fact that the DAQ data is stored in a MongoDB buffer means
        you can look at live data online. Want to look at pulses in a single channel as they are created? No problem. Want
        to browse waveforms that were created by interactions in the detector one second ago? Piece of cake. Want to analyze
        a subset of your data and plot some diagnostics to make sure the quality is good? Super easy. 
    </li>
    <li>Various web packages were used to do things for us so we could focus on functionality. The main style of the site is powered by Twitter's
        <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>.
        Backend to frontend communication, as well as other high-level Javascript functionality is made easy with
        <a href="https://jquery.com/">Jquery</a>. Other smaller packages helped a lot including <a href="http://devoops.me/">devoops</a>,
        <a href="http://summernote.org/">summernote</a>, <a href="http://www.highcharts.com/">Highcharts</a>,
        <a href="http://dygraphs.com/">Dygraphs</a>, <a href="http://bokeh.pydata.org">bokeh</a>, <a href="http://plot.ly">plotly</a>, 
        and <a href="http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a>. We also use <a href="https://www.datatables.net/">datatables</a> 
	for our neat runs and log tables. There is also various Google software included, such as prettify for code markup, and several other 
	small packages.
        The cool OpelGL stuff is pretty easy with <a href="http://threejs.org/">Three.js</a>.

        And of course a few development tools like <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/">PyCharm</a> and 
	<a href="https://www.github.com">GitHub</a> make life just so much easier.
